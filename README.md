# Safari Amzn

Tiny Safari extension to shorten product urls in Amazon. Works silently in the background so you can always
copy and paste a short link from your address bar.

This does not use the short url from Amazon, but simply removes all unnessecary cruft from the regular link.

No download available yet.
